# About Polycarp Institute

Ordained by John the Apostle, Bishop Polycarp of Smyrna taught his disciples to
love and trust the Lord Jesus Christ. For the crime of honoring Jesus above the
"Holy" Roman Emperor, Polycarp was executed as fortold by his own prophecy. At
Polycarp Institute, we aim for such courage and devotion.

We strive to create an encouraging environment where learning is as unhindered
as we can feasibly make it. We believe that students can be largely
self-motivated if we allow their own interests to guide their studies.
