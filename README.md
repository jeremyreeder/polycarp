## About Polycarp Institute

Bishop Polycarp of Smyrna, having been ordained by John the Apostle, taught his
disciples to love and trust the Lord Jesus Christ. For the crime of honoring
Jesus above the "Holy" Roman Emperor, Polycarp was executed as fortold by his
own prophecy. At Polycarp Institute, we aim for such devotion and courage as
this man had.

We strive to consciously create an encouraging environment where learning is as
unhindered as we can feasibly make it. We believe that students can be largely
self-motivated if we allow their own interests to guide their studies.
